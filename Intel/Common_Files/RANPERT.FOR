c For HJCFIT (called in HJCLIK). To put into theta() a version of the 'previous best'
c parameters into which a random perturbation has been added, to prevent looping
c The perturbation is in the range +/- perfac, e.g. perfac=0.1 for
c a perturbation that gives a value in the range 90% to 110% of thmin(i)
