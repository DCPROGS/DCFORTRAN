	subroutine JLOGO1(xmin,xmax,njump,t1,t2,

c JLOGO1 os modified version in which the Y positions for the logos
c are given in scaled units (y1,y2) rather than abs screen units) -used
c in VPLOTQ
c To draw jump logos in VPLOTR. Time of start,end of each jump=t1,t2
c Level, in screen units (0-7000), =iy1 at 'holding' level; iy2 during jump.

c START
c 1st skip through all jumps that end BEFORE the current Xmin so entirely
c off screen until 1st one found that ends AFTER xmin (NB could start before
c xmin, and also could start and/or end after xmax, so no part of jump #i2
