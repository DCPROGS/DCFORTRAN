	subroutine DEFSUB(
c
c Experimental routine for manual sublevel fit e.g.
c (1) First define transition times (or alter those based on previous
c	auto-fit)
c (2) Next define 'amp after first transition' as in DEFAMP, and
c	draw first transition -so can 'see where we are'
c (3) define 'amp after 2nd transition' -rcalc convolution and draw
c	'response' so far etc . . .
